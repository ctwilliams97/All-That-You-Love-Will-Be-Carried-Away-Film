'INT. UNKNOWN DARK SPACE
The screen is dark. Distant FOOTSTEPS and voices are audible but too muffled to be understood. The FOOTSTEPS get louder as the unknown character gets close. A bright light shines across the screen as a door is opened, revealing that we are inside the boot of a car. ALFIE ZIMMER, a travelling salesman begins to load his merchandise into the boot of the car, stored inside worn cardboard boxes. Upon loading in his last box ALFIE sits on the edge of the open boot and takes a big lungful of air. We hear the WIND and BIRDS WHISTLING underscored by the distant sound of TRAFFIC on the motorway. ALFIE stands up and shuts the boot.
INT. FRONT OF CAR - DAY - MOVING
ALFIE drives along the motorway, eyes fixed on the road ahead. He is on autopilot.
ALFIE (V.O.)
The road is a living thing.
Bridges pass over head, obscuring the grey sky.
                   ALFIE (CONT’D)
          Constantly moving
Cars speed past interweaving intricately .
                   ALFIE (CONT’D)

Builders shown working on road works.
ALFIE (CONT’D)
It is its own ecosystem. And like
all living things, the road attracts parasites and disease, who suck the life out of it.
INT. SERVICE STATION FOOD COURT - DAY
ALFIE sits in the middle of a bustling food court in a modern service station.
ALFIE (V.O.)
I live my life on the road. No
matter how far I go, it never changes. Not really. Sometimes I find comfort in that. The familiarity.

INT. SERVICE STATION RESTROOM
ALFIE faces directly into the camera. He is sat on the toilet, trousers around his ankles.
ALFIE (V.O.)
It can be a lonely life. A lot of
the time it’s just me and my thoughts.
ALFIE spots something on the closed cubicle door.
                   ALFIE (CONT’D)
          However, when I see a long
forgotten message from a fellow weary traveller. I remember none of us are very really alone.
The back of the cubicle door is plastered in graffiti. In the centre of the scribblings, written in striking white marker is the message: ALL THAT YOU LOVE WILL BE CARRIED AWAYr'
